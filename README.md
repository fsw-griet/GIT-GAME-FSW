**Welcome to the Game!** 🎮

Hello, adventurer! 👋

Welcome to **Level 1** of your journey. Your mission begins with solving a riddle that will guide you to the next step in this adventure. 🗺️

## Note: first run the `./setup.sh` in your bash terminal 🖥️

### **Cipher Quest** 🔑

Guess the word from numbers:

Numbers: 68, 69, 67, 82, 89, 80, 84. 🔢  
Convert each number to its corresponding letter (ASCII code) to get the word **X**. 🔠  
Rotate the word **X** clockwise:

Rotate the characters of **X** three times to the right 🔄.  
The resulting word is **Y**.

**Example of rotating a word**:

Let's say the word is **"EXAMPLE"**. To rotate it 3 times to the right:

- **1st rotation**: Move the last letter to the front → **"EEXAMPL"**
- **2nd rotation**: Move the last letter to the front again → **"LEEXAMP"**
- **3rd rotation**: Move the last letter to the front once more → **"PLEEXAM"**

So, after 3 rotations, the word becomes **"PLEEXAM"**.

Now, save the result **Y** in `level1_submit.txt` and then add, commit the changes. ✔️

The next clue will be displayed in your bash terminal after completing the Quest! 🌟

Good luck!
