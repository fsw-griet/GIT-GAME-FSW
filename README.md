Ah, it seems you need to check all the available branches! 🧭 To view both local and remote branches, run:

git branch -a
This will list all branches, so you can see where you are and find the one you need to get back to. 🏃‍♂️

Once you've identified your previous branch, use:

git checkout branch-name
Where branch-name is the name of the branch you want to return to.

Good luck, adventurer! 💻✨
